# GAuthorizer

Neatly packaged OAuth authorization via Google in Swift using GTMAppAuth. For using APIs such as the Google Drive API once Google disallows the use of embedded/web views for OAuth authorization.

Or: Just an example to get GTMAppAuth to work in Swift as a replacement of [Google's official iOS Quickstart guide](https://developers.google.com/drive/ios/quickstart?ver=swift) (to do authorization for the Google Drive API in this case). As of mid December 2016, the guide is outdated and will NOT work for new projects or stop working for existing, untouched projects around April 2017. Also, see my stackoverflow answer [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/41059043/893774).

I'll add the walk-through to integrate the code provided in asap.
